# Elephant-Train-Detection-ML
This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting elephants using thermal camera footage. The project aims to develop an AI-based solution to mitigate elephant accidents on Sri Lankan railways by identifying elephants in real-time. The model initially classifies animals and then focuses on detecting elephants specifically.
